# Mapping_Earthquakes

**Overview**
In this project, we built data visualizations with interactive features using data from a non-profit organization who's mission is to report data-backed stories about disasters around the world. This involves using JavaScript and APIs to visually tell a story about earthquakes around the world.

**Challenge Summary**
Tectonic plate data was collected from a GitHub user who uploaded a GeoJSON file contining the boundaries of tectonic plates around the world. Adding this data as another layer to the earthquake map allows the user to toggle visibility of the fault lines and earthquake data. There are also three viewing layers available; street view, satellite view, and light view.
